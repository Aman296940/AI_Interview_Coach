# Interview AI Coach

An AI-powered Interview Practice platform where users can attend mock interviews, answer questions, and receive **personalized feedback, scoring, better answers, and study topics** to improve their performance.  

The system has a **frontend (React)** for user interaction and a **backend (Node.js + Express + MongoDB)** for authentication, question generation, and evaluation.
